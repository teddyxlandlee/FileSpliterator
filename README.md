## Usage
 File Spliterator can split files to small parts and put them back in to a big file again.
 For example, I have a file which is 130MB and I can't upload it to GitHub, so I use File Spliterator to Split the files to 49.6MB, 49.6MB and 30.8MB to upload it to GitHub. After I went to work, I download the 3+1 files and use File Spliterator again to put these files together again.
 This is a convenient tool to let you storage large files on GitHub or other websites.
